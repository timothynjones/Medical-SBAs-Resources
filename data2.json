            "question": "A 70-year-old gentleman is brought into A&E by an ambulance complaining of substernal chest pain since this morning, associated with vomiting twice. He has had chest pain on walking up hills for the last few months but this pain is now present when sitting down. Aspirin, morphine and GTN spray have been given. Which of the following is the most important first investigation?",

            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "A 12-lead ECG is needed in the first instance to determine if there is ST-elevation or equivalent, in which case urgent referral for primary PCI will be required."

                "correctIndex": 4,
                "explanation": "All of the above, other than rheumatoid arthritis can cause a raised serum troponin. Troponin leak is caused by injury to cardiomyocytes, which can be from ischaemia (i.e. an MI), inflammation (i.e. myocarditis), strain/pressure overload (e.g. a PE) or metabolic toxicity (e.g. uraemia)."

                "correctIndex": 1,
                "explanation": "The ECG shows ischaemic ST-elevation in the anterior leads V2-V4 (with less in V5 and V6). There is some reciprocal ST-depression/T-wave inversion in the inferior leads. This is consistent with an anterior STEMI, which is caused by an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery."

                "explanation": "Lifestyle advice and prognostic medications such as statins, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are a key part of the management after an MI. Additionally, patients usually continue dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 year, and then remain on aspirin lifelong. Cardiac resynchronisation therapy may be indicated, if there is heart failure with a persistent decrease in EF at 6 weeks (<35%) and there is a significant conduction delay (either QRS >120 ms with LBBB or >150 ms with RBBB), but it does not form part of the immediate management."

                "correctIndex": 2,
                "explanation": "This gentleman has severe compromising bradycardia. The ECG strip shows complete (3rd degree) heart block. He has failed to respond to atropine, so the most important next step is trancutaneous pacing to externally pace and stabilise his blood pressure. Although isoprenaline may be used in addition to transcutaneous pacing, it is not the most important next step. He may well require a permanent pacemaker in the coming hours but he needs stabilisation first."

                "explanation": "The ECG shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and needs immediate treatment as it could progress to pulseless VT/a cardiac arrest. Since his observations (including BP) are stable, he can be treated with IV amiodarone and does not require DC cardioversion. If his BP was reduced or he was shocked, DC cardioversion would be more appropriate. He will also need a cardiac monitor."

                "correctIndex": 0,
                "explanation": "This lady has acute heart failure with pulmonary oedema. She needs urgent treatment with IV furosemide to reduce pulmonary venous pressure, reduce pulmonary oedema and improve oxygenation. Oral furosemide will not work fast enough acutely. IV nitrates may form part of the management, but are not first line. CPAP can be used for resistant pulmonary oedema."

                "correctIndex": 3,
                "explanation": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is caused by mutations in genes encoding myocardial proteins (such as beta myoson, alpha tropomyoson or troponin. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning the baby will have a 1 in 2 chance of inheriting the diseased gene."

                "correctIndex": 0,
                "explanation": "NICE guidelines state that the first line treatment for hypertension in those ≥ 55 or of Afro-Caribbean origin should be a non-cardioselective calcium channel blocker. In those <55 who are not of Afro-Caribbean origin, an ACE inhibitor is first line. Amlodipine is a non-cardioselective calcium channel blocker, unlike verapamil, therefore is most appropriate."

                "answers": ["Mitral stenosis","Mitral valve prolapse","Aortic stenosis","Aortic regurgitation","Infective endocarditis"],
                "correctIndex": 1,
                "explanation": "A mid-systolic click occurs when the mitral valve opens during ventricular systole (mitral valve prolapse) and then allows blood to regurgitate into the left atrium at the end of systole (causing a late systolic murmur). Mitral stenosis causes a mid to late diastolic murmur with pre-systolic accentuation. Aortic stenosis causes and ejection systolic murmur. Aortic regurgitation causes an early diastolic murmur."

            "correctIndex": 4,
            "explanation": "The deep femoral artery supplies the thigh muscles, unlike the femoral artery proper which gives rise to the popliteal artery to supply the distal leg. If structures more proximal to the femoral artery (such as the internal iliac artery) were diseased, his pain may well be more widespread in the leg."

            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "The fact that his pain is worse when walking downhill (rather than uphill), points away from ischaemic disease, as does the normal vascular examination. These symptoms are most typical of spinal canal stenosis."

Examination reveals that the left leg is pale and cool and distal pulses are impalpable. Pulses on the right leg are strong. She has a past medical history of hypertension and alcohol excess. She is given IV morphine. A 12-lead ECG reveals atrial fibrillation. Which of the following is most likely to be the single best management option?",

            "correctIndex": 2,
            "explanation": "The sudden onset and fact that the patient has atrial fibrillation suggests that the ischaemia may be secondary to an embolic phenomenon (i.e. a dislodged thrombus from the heart blocking a peripheral artery). This usually can be treated with embolectomy (with a Fogarty catheter) +- the local administration of thrombolysis. Ischaemia caused by thrombus formation cannot be treated as easily and usually needs bypass surgery. Amputation would be needed if there were signs of irreversible necrosis."

            "explanation": "This clinical presentation likely represents a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Since the patient has reached A&E alive, it is likely that the bleeding has been tamponaded by a clot in the retroperitoneum. Unless the patient is obtunded due to haemorrhagic shock, IV fluids should not be used before theatre as they increase blood pressure and hence the risk of dislodging this clot and rebleeding."

            "explanation": "This is a difficult question; although the majority of patients presenting with RUQ pain will have complications of gallstones or another acute abdominal pathology, it is important to recognise signs and symptoms suggestive of referred pain. Low oxygen saturation, tachypnoea, a history of a cough, a smoking history and a fever are all suggestive of a chest infection. Lower lobe pneumonia can present with upper abdominal pain. The most appropriate investigations for a suspected pneumonia causing sepsis are ABG, cultures and chest radiograph. LFTs and US RUQ would be useful to assess for complications of gallstones (e.g. cholangitis) which is a differential but less likely in this context. CT abdomen is not needed as first line (but may be needed if the above investigations fail to reveal the diagnosis). Option C describes the investigations for suspected pyelonephritis, which is also a differential, but is more likely to present with flank pain and dysuria. Abdominal radiography is unlikely to be helpful as its main uses are suspected bowel obstruction or perforation."

            "explanation": "Presenting with fluid overload and 3+ of protein in the urine suggests a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, and not cardiac, lung or liver disease. Chronic, poorly controlled RA is a risk factor for AA amyloidosis, which can cause nephrotic syndrome. This is caused by the deposition of serum amyloid A protein (which is an acute phase reactant and raised in chronic inflammation) in the kidney. Definitive diagnosis would be from a kidney biopsy."

            "correctIndex": 1,
            "explanation": "Methotrexate is the mainstay of disease-modifying therapy for most patients with RA. It can cause renal impairment by crystallisation in the renal tubules. It is usually taken once a week (not once a day) and is not safe in pregnancy. It is a folate antagonist therefore can cause a macrocytic (not microcytic anaemia). Another side effect is pulmonary fibrosis, but it usually causes a lower lobe fibrosis."

            "explanation": "This presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of gout. The nodules on the ears suggest gouty tophi. He has a number of risk factors for gout, including CKD, heart failure and diuretic therapy. Additionally, the bloods reveal a raised CRP but normal WCC, which makes septic arthritis less likely than gout. Gout is caused by the deposition of negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals of urate in the synovium (c.f. positively birefringent rhomboid-shaped crystals, which are more consistent with pseudogout/calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease). Detecting organisms on Gram staining would be consistent with septic arthritis. The serum urate is often not elevated in acute gout flares (as it is deposited out into the joints)."

            "correctIndex": 3,
            "explanation": "Psoriatic arthritis is one of the four seronegative spondyloarthropathies (the others being ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis and enteropathy-associated arthritis). It has an equal sex distribution and is associated with HLA-B27. In 70% of patients, the skin disease precedes the joint disease, in 15% they occur simultaneously and in the final 15%, the skin disease occurs after joint disease is established. In those with only skin disease, nail changes such as pitting, ridging and onycholysis increase the risk that joint disease will develop. It has a better prognosis than RA and usually requires less aggressive treatment."
